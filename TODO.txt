Icons 1 and 3 looks too much the same when youre stressed by playing,
so maybe icon 3 should be remade?

Headshot sound. (Unreal tournament feeling)
Doublekill sound. (Unreal tournament feeling)
Multikill sound. (Unreal tournament feeling)
Sound when you get the flag.
Sound when you drop the flag.
Sound when you capture the flag and score a point.

Spriteanimation for flag (5x5 px).
Find a metaphor for the flag. (Powercube? Gasbox?)

Describe new 1 player game mode.

Sort out the sound effects volumes. Some are louder than others?
Less annoying soundtrack in headphones, a bit too pitchy? 
 - When you listen to it a lot it gets annoying, maybe more tracks will fix that? Would be nice and cool with one more musictrack for the game?

When canvas size changes, so does the position of canvasses. We need them to be positioned dynamically.
Align gamepoints with canvas -> Different monitors?
We need to remake the entire screen layout + transitions between screens:
	- Screen 1: How many players? What Gamemode? Fullscreen button.
	- Screen 2: Player names, customize button, start game.
	- Screen 3: Gamescreen, return to the other screens.
	- Screen 4: Game statistics -> Show who did what in the game. Headshots etc.
No æøå in name input (no sound effect when pressed)

Figure out what pattern to use for gamemode
Cannot start in opposite random direction
So.. the grid in Y direction is very very long? Why? It actually wasnt, but the grid was set to expand. 
Update the game to using vectors instead of X and Y coordinates all over the place.
