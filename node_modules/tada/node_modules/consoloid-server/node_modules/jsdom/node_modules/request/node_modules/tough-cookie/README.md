# Synopsis

``` javascript
var tough = require('tough-cookie');
var Cookie = tough.Cookie;
var cookie = Cookie.parse(header);
cookie.value = 'somethingdifferent';
header = cookie.toString();

var cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar();
cookiejar.setCookie(cookie, 'http://currentdomain.example.com/path', cb);
// ...
cookiejar.getCookies('http://example.com/otherpath',function(err,cookies) {
  res.headers['cookie'] = cookies.join('; ');
});
```

# Installation

It's _so_ easy!

`npm install tough-cookie`

Why the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.

# API

## tough

Functions on the module you get from `require('tough-cookie')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don't need to be "bound".

**Note**: prior to 1.0.x, several of these functions took a `strict` parameter. This has since been removed from the API as it was no longer necessary.

### `parseDate(string)`

Parse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.

### `formatDate(date)`

Format a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).

### `canonicalDomain(str)`

Transforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).

### `domainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])`

Answers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".

The `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two paramters through `canonicalDomain` or not.

### `defaultPath(path)`

Given a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.

The `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node's `uri.parse()` output.

### `pathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)`

Answers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.

This is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.

### `parse(header)`

alias for `Cookie.parse(header)`

### `fromJSON(string)`

alias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`

### `getPublicSuffix(hostname)`

Returns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.

For example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.

For further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site.

### `cookieCompare(a,b)`

For use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2). The sort algorithm is, in order of precedence:

* Longest `.path`
* oldest `.creation` (which has a 1ms precision, same as `Date`)
* lowest `.creationIndex` (to get beyond the 1ms precision)

``` javascript
var cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];
cookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);
```

**Note**: Since JavaScript's `Date` is limited to a 1ms precision, cookies within the same milisecond are entirely possible. This is especially true when using the `now` option to `.setCookie()`. The `.creationIndex` property is a per-process global counter, assigned during construction with `new Cookie()`. This preserves the spirit of the RFC sorting: older cookies go first. This works great for `MemoryCookieStore`, since `Set-Cookie` headers are parsed in order, but may not be so great for distributed systems. Sophisticated `Store`s may wish to set this to some other _logical clock_ such that if cookies A and B are created in the same millisecond, but cookie A is created before cookie B, then `A.creationIndex < B.creationIndex`. If you want to alter the global counter, which you probably _shouldn't_ do, it's stored in `Cookie.cookiesCreated`.

### `permuteDomain(domain)`

Generates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.

### `permutePath(path)`

Generates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.


## Cookie

Exported via `tough.Cookie`.

### `Cookie.parse(header)`

Parses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can't be parsed.

Here's how to process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:

``` javascript
if (res.headers['set-cookie'] instanceof Array)
  cookies = res.headers['set-cookie'].map(function (c) { return (Cookie.parse(c)); });
else
  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers['set-cookie'])];
```

### Properties

Cookie object properties:

  * _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default "")
  * _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default "")
  * _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `"Infinity"`). See `setExpires()`
  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`
  * _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie
  * _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie
  * _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag
  * _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag
  * _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)
  * _creation_ - `Date` - when this cookie was constructed
  * _creationIndex_ - number - set at construction, used to provide greater sort precision (please see `cookieCompare(a,b)` for a full explanation)

After a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it will have the following additional attributes:

  * _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (i.e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)
  * _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.
  * _creation_ - `Date` - **modified** from construction to when the cookie was added to the jar
  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.

### `Cookie([{properties}])`

Receives an options object that can contain any of the above Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.

### `.toString()`

encode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.

### `.cookieString()`

encode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with '=').

### `.setExpires(String)`

sets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can't parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.

### `.setMaxAge(number)`

sets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.

### `.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])`

### `.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])`

expiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.

Max-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.creation` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.

If Expires (`.expires`) is set, that's returned.

Otherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).

### `.TTL([now=Date.now()])`

compute the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds).  The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.

The "number" `Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired.  Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.

### `.canonicalizedDoman()`

### `.cdomain()`

return the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.

### `.toJSON()`

For convenience in using `JSON.serialize(cookie)`. Returns a plain-old `Object` that can be JSON-serialized.

Any `Date` properties (i.e., `.expires`, `.creation`, and `.lastAccessed`) are exported in ISO format (`.toISOString()`).

**NOTE**: Custom `Cookie` properties will be discarded. In tough-cookie 1.x, since there was no `.toJSON` method explicitly defined, all enumerable properties were captured. If you want a property to be serialized, add the property name to the `Cookie.serializableProperties` Array.

### `Cookie.fromJSON(strOrObj)`

Does the reverse of `cookie.toJSON()`. If passed a string, will `JSON.parse()` that first.

Any `Date` properties (i.e., `.expires`, `.creation`, and `.lastAccessed`) are parsed via `Date.parse()`, not the tough-cookie `parseDate`, since it's JavaScript/JSON-y timestamps being handled at this layer.

Returns `null` upon JSON parsing error.

### `.clone()`

Does a deep clone of this cookie, exactly implemented as `Cookie.fromJSON(cookie.toJSON())`.

### `.validate()`

Status: *IN PROGRESS*. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.

validates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:

``` javascript
if (cookie.validate() === true) {
  // it's tasty
} else {
  // yuck!
}
```


## CookieJar

Exported via `tough.CookieJar`.

### `CookieJar([store],[rejectPublicSuffixes])`

Simply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you'd like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.

### Properties

CookieJar object properties:

  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk" (default: `true`)

Since eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. CookieJars, continuation passing style is used for CookieJar methods.

### `.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))`

Attempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.creation`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.

The `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:

  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.
  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.
  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies
  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  `Store` errors aren't ignored by this option.

As per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).

### `.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options}])`

Synchronous version of `setCookie`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

### `.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))`

Retrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.

If an error is encountered, that's passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an `Array` of `Cookie` objects is passed.  The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.

The `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:

  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.
  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.
  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies
  * _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.  Using `false` will return expired cookies and **not** remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers, potentially).
  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the underlying store (the default `MemoryCookieStore` supports it).

The `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.

### `.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])`

Synchronous version of `getCookies`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

### `.getCookieString(...)`

Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.

### `.getCookieStringSync(...)`

Synchronous version of `getCookieString`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).

### `.getSetCookieStrings(...)`

Returns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()`.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.

### `
